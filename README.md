# Image Password Strength

Password Strength Background is a web project that enhances the user experience of creating strong passwords by incorporating an interactive background effect. This project is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. When users enter their password, the background image starts off blurred and gradually becomes clearer as they type more characters, encouraging them to create longer and more secure passwords.
